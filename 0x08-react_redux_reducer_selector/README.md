0. **Write a basic reducer** - Reuse the latest dashboard project you worked on in the React course `0x08-React_Redux_action_creator+normalizr`. Create the basic state, Crate the reducer function and write the tests
1. **Use Immutable for the UI Reducer** - Now that you have set up a basic reducer, let's reuse what we learned in the Immutable module and apply it to that reducer
2. **Create a reducer for Courses** - Create a load action, create the course reducer and default state, define the `FETCH_COURSE_SUCCESS` action, Define the `SELECT_COURSE` and `UNSELECT_COURSE` actions and write the tests
3. **Create the reducer for notifications** - Create a load action, Create the notifications reducer and default state, define the `FETCH_NOTIFICATIONS_SUCCESS` action, define the `MARK_AS_READ` action and define the `SET_TYPE_FILTER` action
4. **Normalizr & Immutable** - Work on the course schema and inthe course reducer function, update the notification schema, update the notification reducer and update the test files/suites
5. **Selectors** - Selectors are an efficient way to access the data from the state because a selector is not recomputed unless one of its arguments change. Create a few selectors for the Notifications reducer in `src/selectors/notificationSelector.js`, Create a test suite for your selectors in a file named `src/selectors/notificationSelector.test.js`
