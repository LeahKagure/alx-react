0. **Basic components** - Start with your files from the last task of the `0x01. React intro` project. Instead of creating new elements, we're going to create components to split the project. The `App.js` is going to become the main entry point, the shell, for every component in the app
1. **Write the tests for each component** - To develop your tests faster, you can watch them. The test suite will run for every change you make: *Add the following script to `task_1/package.json: "test-watch": "jest --watch"* and *run your suite using `npm run test-watch*
2. **Split the Notifications component** - The Notifications component is repeating the same tags a lot. It will be hard to maintain and reuse. Let's create a compnent to support the `li` generation
3. **Checking the application using the React extension** - Use the React extension in Chrome, and follow the provided instructions
4. **Props types & Default props & Shapes** - To work on this task, install `prop-types` with npm first
5. **Shapes, Loops, and Keys** - Create a new Shape named `CourseShape` and modify using the given instructions
